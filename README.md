# ReadngTextFilePythonProject
This is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) Text File Reader written in Python. It provides users with the ability to open a .txt file, read its contents, and speak the text out using the pyttsx3 library. The project includes a basic graphical user interface using tkinter, where users can open a file using a file dialog and specify a custom reading speed.
